                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Maria Bruner, originally from Lasalle-Peru, Illinois. Before entering the world of web development, I moved to Indiana to attend Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. At Rose I was able to play for the varsity volleyball team all four years before graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. During my time at Rose I fell in love with writing code through some entry-level coding and robotics courses, but never considered pursuing further. </p>

                    <p>Since I graduated I have moved to Indianapolis and have been working as a Quality Engineer and Carbon Printer Design Engineer at Makuta, INC., a micromolding company in Shelbyville, IN. After approximately a year of working in industry, I found myself studying code in my free time and looking at ways to pursue a career in web development. That's when I discovered ElevenFifty Academy's Web Development Bootcamp, which has helped me confirm my passion for writing code. Since March of 2021 I have been learning Javascript, HTML, CSS, and all of the necessary tools to begin a career in web development. My projects below are shown in chronological order, so you will hopefully be able to see how I grew as a developer throughout the course. </p>
